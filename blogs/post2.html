<p class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 mb-4">A drone is only as good as the data it collects. Our focus on sensor fusion is what sets ANZU's data capture capabilities apart.</p>

<p>We've integrated a powerful array of sensors, but the real innovation lies in how we process their data together. This process, known as **sensor fusion**, combines information from multiple sources to create a more accurate and reliable understanding of the environment than any single sensor could provide.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Key Sensors in the Payload Bay</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>**Lidar:** For high-resolution 3D point cloud generation and terrain mapping.</li>
    <li>**Hyperspectral Camera:** Captures light across many narrow bands, essential for agricultural health monitoring and mineral detection.</li>
    <li>**Thermal Imager:** Used for identifying heat signatures in search and rescue or monitoring equipment health.</li>
</ul>

<p>All sensor data is timestamped and synchronized using a custom internal board before transmission, ensuring that the final data products (like orthomosaics and digital elevation models) are accurate and geometrically consistent.</p>
