<p class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 mb-4">From initial concepts to detailed CAD models, the design phase of ANZU was driven by a single goal: maximum payload capacity with minimum drag.</p>

<p>The structural design of the quadrotor frame utilizes a **lightweight carbon fiber composite**. This material choice was non-negotiable, offering an incredible strength-to-weight ratio that maximizes flight time and payload capacity.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</h3>
<p>To optimize the shape of the arms and fuselage, we ran extensive **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations**. These tests helped us iterate on the design to reduce turbulence and energy waste, ensuring efficient cruising speed and battery life.</p>

<p>The final frame design is modular, allowing for quick field repairs and interchangeability of different sensor mounting brackets. This flexibility is what makes ANZU a true multi-mission platform.</p>
